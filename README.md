# SpeedCatcher ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

SpeedCatcher is a Python-based speed detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It tracks vehicles in real-time from a webcam or video file, estimates their speed based on pixel distance and calibration lines, and captures screenshots of speeding vehicles. All data is logged and visualized in a live dashboard.
